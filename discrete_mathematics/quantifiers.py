# The cube of every nonzero real number is nonzero.

# Precedence of Quantifiers 
# The quantifiers ∀ and ∃ have higher precedence than all logical operations from propositional calculus.

# When a quantifier is used on a variable x, we say that this occurrence of the variable is bound.
# An occurrence of a variable that is not bound by a quantifier or set equal to a particular value is said to be free
# All the variables that occur in a proposition function must be 
# ∃x(x + y = 1), the variable x is bound by the existential quantification ∃x, but the variable y is free
# because it is not bound by a quantifier and no value is assigned to this variable.
# This illustrates that the statement 
# because the scopes of the two quantifiers do not overlap.
